# [Amazon Web Scraper Using Python](https://aljocastro.github.io/AmazonWebScrapper/)

In this project, I built a Python-based Amazon price tracker that automatically monitors a product’s price. Using BeautifulSoup and Requests, the scraper connects to an specific web page, retrieves key details, cleans and structures the data. The script can run at scheduled intervals, making it a simple yet effective automation tool.

  * Data Source: Amazon product pages.
  * Libraries Used: BeautifulSoup, Requests.
  * Functionality: Web scraping, data extraction, data analysis.
  * Goal: Amazon Price Tracker to automate the process of tracking price drops for specific products.
  * Write-up: The complete walkthrough and code are published here.  
   
   
## Result: Amazon Price Tracker
This Amazon Price Tracker is a Python automation tool that monitors Amazon product prices and sends an email alert when the price drops below a defined threshold.
It uses BeautifulSoup and Requests to scrape live product data, logs each check with a timestamp for historical tracking, and leverages smtplib to deliver instant notifications.
